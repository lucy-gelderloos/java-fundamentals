# Inheritance

## Architecture

### Business.java

- Children:
  - Restaurant
  - Shop
  - Theater
- Properties:
  - String `name`  
  - String `priceCategory`
  - String `businessType`
  - ArrayList<String> `reviewsList`
- Constructor
  - *Business(String name, String priceCategory, String businessType)*
- Methods
  - *addReview(String body, String author, int rating, Business business)* adds a review to the business' list of reviews, then calls *updateAverageRating*.
  - *addReview(String body, String author, int rating, Theater theater, String movie)* adds a review including the movie viewed to the theater's list of reviews, then calls *updateAverageRating*.
  - *updateAverageRating(Business business)* iterates through the business' list of reviews, sums each rating, and divides by the total number of reviews to get the average rating.
  - *getAllReviews(Business business)* first determines if the review list has any entries; if no, it returns an empty string. If yes, it starts with an output string with "Review:" on a single line. It then iterates through the restaurant's list of reviews, calls *Review.toReviewString* on each, and adds each resulting string. Each review string except the last is followed by a newline.
  - *toBusinessString(Business business)* concatenates the business' name, rating, and price category, followed by the string returned from *getAllReviews*.
  - *toBusinessString(Restaurant restaurant)* concatenates the restaurant's name, chain name (if present), rating, and price category, followed by the string returned from *getAllReviews*.
  - *toBusinessString(Theater theater)* concatenates the theater's name, rating, and price category, followed by the string returned from *Theater.getAllMovies*, followed by the string returned from *getAllReviews*.
- **Notes:**
  - `priceCategory` options are "$", "$$", "$$$", "$$$$"
  - `businessType` options are "restaurant", "shop", "theater"

- Methods
  - *toReviewString(Review review)* concatenates the review body, rating, and author
  - *updateStars(Review review, int newRating)* updates the star rating of the provided review with the provided value

## Testing

- *testRestaurantConstructor* confirms that the name property of the generated restaurant matches the input/expected name
- *testToRestStringNoReviews* confirms that the string generated by *Restaurant.toRestString* when no reviews are present matches the following format: "<restaurant name>: <average rating> stars, <price category>"
- *testToRestStringWithReviews* adds reviews to the test restaurant. It first confirms that the string generated by *Restaurant.toRestString* when reviews are present matches the following format: "<restaurant name>: <average rating> stars, <price category>", followed by a new line, followed by each review on a separate line. It then confirms that the restaurant's average rating has been updated appropriately.
- *testReviewConstructor* confirms that the body, author, and rating properties of the generated review match the input
- *testReviewString* confirms that the string generated by *Review.toReviewString* matches the following format: "<body> | <rating> stars. -<author>"
- *testAddReview* confirms that after adding a single review to a restaurant, the review list is not empty and the new head node points to the old head (aka null).
